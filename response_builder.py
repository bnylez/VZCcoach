6. Overall Coaching Recommendations:
---------------------------------------------------------
- **Focus on Phone Adds:** You need to average approximately {phone["daily_phone_target_1_0"]:.2f} adds per day to meet the base target or {phone["daily_phone_target_1_3"]:.2f} for stretch. Consider prioritizing calls that convert into phone add dollars.
- **Boost Internet Activations:** With a target of {internet["daily_internet_target_1_0"]:.2f} adds for base and {internet["daily_internet_target_1_3"]:.2f} for stretch, increase your emphasis on home internet upsells if the opportunity arises.
- **Combined Strategy:** Optimizing your bundle offers could help meet the combined target, given your current combined adds average of {averages["current_combined_avg"]:.2f} per day.
- **Revenue Push:** Given the current revenue performance, continue to leverage high-margin products and upsell to maximize your earnings.
  
Keep pushing, and stay focused on the most critical gap areas. Your efforts today will set the pace for a successful period!
